There is only one reason to learn python: the computing job market and ecosphere demands it. Python became important not because it's better or easier than other languages (it's objectively the poor cousin to most serious languages) but because it was sold as simple to learn and powerful and that led to wide adoption and a rapid expansion of tools and libraries that allowed for lazy programming. Embrace it by all means but it's the computer language world equivalent of Windoze - a poor product well sold.,Positive Review

"I'm an electrical engineer but I had no coding experience whatsoever before freshmen year. They just threw us in the fire with no help and horrible teaching at a fast pace! I struggled so much and never really got the full picture or a high level understanding of anything! This was partly my fault for not taking the initiative but mostly the teacher's fault for being horrible. After the first week, the professor was shocked by how many kids were coming to him and asking how to even download Python on their computers lol. Finally in the beginning of one of our classes he was like ""Okay it seems like most of you have never coded before? I thought you would all be experts at this point... This might be a rough semester for some of you."" For an intro class????? Well long story short the majority of kids did horrible (myself included) and the course was curved soo much that I got a B by getting 40's and 60's on my exam. I passed but probably shouldn't have. I was traumatized that I never wanted to touch it again!!! A few years later now and I am trying to go back and learn it for work and I'm enjoying it so much! Learning at a reasonable pace with teachers that aren't horrible is a game changer...Plus it's free/cheap! Thank goodness I found these videos and other resources! Everything is clicking now, I just wish I found this sooner SMH",Neutral Review
